### Description
This is a small add-on that makes a rather minor change to the UI to show both the player and bank free space and maximum size.

I have found it annoying that you do not know your backpack (plus horse) space available while playing. This makes it more likely to run out of inventory space while collecting materials or running a dungeon or delve. I don't have a great need for some manager add-on, all I really need is something to let me know where I stand so I can make sure to get the important stuff into the bank.

This is that add-on, written specifically for my own purposes during Early Access and used by me since then.

It adds a floating window that shows the amount of gold, the maximum bag space and amount used, and the maximum bank space and the amount used. These are updated as the information changes. The window can be moved anywhere on the screen, as desired, and the game will remember placement. This window will disappear when the compass at the top of the screen is not visible.

As the amount of space used approaches the maximum, the color will change from white to yellow. I have noticed that the game likes to have about 4 open spaces when doing crafting work, so the yellow will appear in that range. When the bank or backpack is full, the numbers will change to red.

This is identical to the version offered on Nexus.
